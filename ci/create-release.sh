# This script creates a GitHub release for a vendored tarball with release notes
# that indicate whether it was a preemptive build or vendored build.
#
# Usage:
#   ./create-release.sh <tarball_path> <name> <tag> <vcs> <build_type>
#
# Example:
#   ./create-release.sh glow-v1.2.3-deps.tar.xz glow v1.2.3 https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow.git preemptive
#
# Requirements:
#   - gh (GitHub CLI)
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

# These functions write build-type-specific release notes to a file descriptor.
#
# Instead of passing the descriptor around and redirecting each individual `echo` or `cat`,
# we redirect the entire function output using `} >&${fd}`.
#
# This syntax applies the redirection to the **entire compound command** (the function body).
# It must appear **after** the closing brace.
#
# Note: `${fd}` must be assigned and open before these functions are defined.
# If not, Bash will fail to parse or write to an undefined descriptor.
#
# Why this way?
# - Cleaner function bodies (no `>&${fd}` clutter inside)
# - Easier to read and maintain (especially for multiple lines/heredocs)
# - Bash supports it (surprisingly!)
#
# This is legal Bash, if you don't believe me read the FUNCTIONS section of the
# manpage.

**Preemptive Build**

This tarball was built preemptively and may not yet be available in the ebuild repository.
This allows for faster ebuild creation when adding new packages or versions.

Once the corresponding ebuild is created and added to the overlay, this becomes a standard
vendored release.
